# WordReducer

**WordReducer** is a Java program that finds all 9-letter words which can be reduced one letter at a timeâ€”without rearranging the lettersâ€”such that each intermediate word is valid, all the way down to a single-letter word (`"a"` or `"i"`).

This is a recursive word puzzle that demonstrates efficient algorithm design using memoization and set-based lookups.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Loads a dictionary of valid Scrabble words
- Identifies fully reducible 9-letter words
